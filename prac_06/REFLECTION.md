Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

.I've begun setting out certain time slots for practical exercises, which has helped me be more
consistent and focused. Additionally, I analyze code examples more completely before attempting to
develop my own, which has helped cement my comprehension.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

.I need to establish more stringent due dates for assignments in order to better manage my time.
My productivity can occasionally be impacted by procrastination, so creating a planned schedule for
theory and practical work will be beneficial.


## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

...I consistently show up for lectures and practicals, and I take thorough notes in class.
In order to keep interested and clarify concepts, I also try to ask questions when I don't
fully comprehend a subject.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

...I should strive for simpler, easier-to-read solutions rather than overly complex code.
I should also refrain from diving right into coding without first organizing my strategy
to better comprehend the issue and lay out a precise remedy.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

.To improve collaboration and peer learning, I would advise adding additional group projects or pair programming sessions.
To demonstrate how ideas are used outside of the classroom, it would also be advantageous to add additional real-world examples to the homework.
