# Practical 10
# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

...My first estimations were not particularly accurate. I frequently
underestimated how long some activities would take, especially when 
fixing or coming across new concepts.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

...My understanding of the problems increased as I finished more practicals, 
which helped me make more accurate projections. I started organizing time for
solving problems, code reviews, and learning new topics.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

...I learned how important it is to prepare ahead and divide work into simpler
parts that are easier to manage. This not only made the work look less difficult
but it also helped me make better predictions.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

...I learned knowledge about best practices and how to build code
that is clearer and easier to understand. I was able to identify
areas for improvement, such adding comments, simplifying logic, and
making sure that formatting was consistent, thanks to feedback on my work.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

...I learned to see possible mistakes and value different approaches to issues
by looking at other people's code. Seeing how other people tackled the same challenges
also helped me clarify my knowledge of coding topics.
Give two (2) PRs that show your ability to perform quality code reviews for any of the 
previous practices appropriate Markdown links (not plain URLs). Write a brief summary of 
the benefits of your review for each one. Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs)
to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[]()

### Explanation

...I offered helpful feedback on variable name, logic optimization,
and how to make comments clearer in my review. The author was able to make major
changes thanks to my clear and practical feedback.

### Good Code Review 2

[]()

### Explanation

...Improving code readability and following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) concept were
the main goals of this study. Additionally, I suggested simplifying the code with Pythonic
methods, which increased its efficiency.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

...For difficult tasks, I would offer more thorough explanations and instructions, particularly for pupils
who are unfamiliar with specific sources or ideas. Furthermore, offering advanced students optional "challenge
tasks" might maintain everyone's interest.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

...I always paid attention to the details, followed to coding guidelines, and used feedback to get better at what I did.
During group sessions, I also tried to assist classmates, which let me understand the subject matter better.
